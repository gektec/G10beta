**Virtual production** mixes traditional filming with digital techniques like real‐time rendering and motion capture to create interactive, realistic digital environments for film and TV.

This resource provides comprehensive guidance on setting up Unreal Engine and developing immersive virtual production environments. Our tutorials and demos are designed for both beginners and experienced developers, covering essential tools, techniques, and best practices to bring virtual production to life.

### Interactive Example Environment

For a practical demonstration of our work, please explore our [interactive example environment](https://gektec.github.io/G10beta/unreal-engine-tutorial/example_environment/). 


## What You’ll Learn

Our tutorials cover a wide range of topics, including:

- **Unreal Engine Setup**: Get started with Unreal Engine 5. Step-by-step instructions on installing and using Unreal Engine, along with practical techniques for developing virtual environments.
- **Virtual Environment Development**: 
  - Learning how to import and customize models—from either commercially available models or those created using tools like Blender (or your preferred modeling software). 
  - Learning how to use these models to build a virtual environment.
  - Employing additional plugins, such as Fab, Twinmotion, and Datasmith, to streamline the virtual production process.
- **Techniques for Teamwork in Unreal Engine**: Learn collaborative skills essential for virtual production.

We invite you to explore the tutorial modules and interactive demos as a foundation for your own creative projects while making the most of open-source assets.
