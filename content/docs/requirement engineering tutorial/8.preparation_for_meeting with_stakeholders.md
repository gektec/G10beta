After we won the bid for this project, we had a period of hiatus prior to formal contact with stakeholders. Because the stakeholders are busy, it is difficult to make appointments with them. So we had almost three weeks to prepare for formal contact. In the first week, we didn't pay much attention to it, and that was our mistake. But after a meeting with our professor, Dave, we immediately realized the importance of meeting with stakeholders and started focusing on it right away.

First, we looked over the brief description of the project. This project is mainly about virtual production and motion capture. The school and ARRI worked together to build a virtual production studio to shoot the film. The brief for the project was very general, with no details about what we were going to do to help the stakeholders. Moreover, as far as we know, the studio had not been completed yet when we participated in the project. We could only keep guessing what we were going to do. Regardless, we took a closer look at the specifics of virtual production. Each member of our group read at least two papers in this direction. Not only that, but we also checked out ARRI and their studios in other parts of the world to get a better understanding. 

Keeping stakeholders happy is very important during the project process, so we wanted to get to know a few of the stakeholders at the meeting better. We checked their profiles and LinkedIn on the school's official website. There is one example after we did some research:

After doing some basic research, we actually did more research on specific devices and how to connect them because we didn't know exactly what to do yet. We then prepared an outline of the meeting to ensure we were in the right place when it came time for the formal meeting. 

Here is an example of one of our meeting plans:
